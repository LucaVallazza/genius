## ⚠IMPORTANT
*This app was coded following a code-along tutorial with the objective of learning new libraries and frameworks such as Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React, and more. It took around 1 month to complete everything, understanding each step. Finishing this project gave me a full understanding of many important concepts in development and was one of the most important steps in my understanding of how a SaaS (Software as a Service) can be provided using web development.*

*Since I ran out of free API calls and this project is not my own work, I shut down the server. Now, this app only works by running the project and providing the API keys.*
